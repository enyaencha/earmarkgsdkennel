I've created a significant improvement to the shopping cart system with real-time quantity adjustments. Here are the key changes:
Key Improvements:

Added Plus/Minus Buttons:

Implemented intuitive quantity controls with + and - buttons around the input field
Users can now adjust quantities with a single click instead of typing values


Real-time AJAX Updates:

Created a new update_quantity endpoint to handle asynchronous updates
Cart quantities update immediately without page refresh or "Update Cart" button
Subtotals, item totals, and cart count update in real-time


Improved User Experience:

Added a loading overlay to indicate when updates are in progress
Implemented validation to prevent quantities less than 1
Added confirmation dialog when removing items
Prevented accidental form submission when pressing Enter in quantity fields


Visual Enhancements:

Styled the quantity controls for better usability
Improved the layout of quantity controls with flexbox
Removed unnecessary "Update Cart" button since updates happen automatically


Backend Improvements:

Added proper JSON response handling for AJAX requests
Maintained backward compatibility with the original update method
Implemented proper error handling for failed AJAX requests



The cart now provides a much smoother, more intuitive shopping experience. Quantities update instantly when changed, and all related totals update automatically without requiring the user to click "Update Cart".
